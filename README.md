# NAND Firmware Validation Framework

This project simulates a simple NAND storage device and provides a Python-based validation framework for functional, edge-case, and stress testing. It's designed to demonstrate core skills required for a Firmware Validation Engineer role, such as test strategy design, automation, and debugging.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Clone the repository or copy the files into a folder.
3. Run the test suite:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

Test logs will appear in `logs/test_log.txt`, and a summary report will be written to `report/test_summary.md`.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Simulates NAND operations: `read_page`, `write_page`, `erase_block`
- Enforces NAND rules: no overwrite before erase, bad block handling
- Provides unittest-based test scripts for:
  - Functional correctness
  - Edge-case handling (like writing to bad blocks)
  - Stress and regression testing
- Uses Python logging to track actions and debug failures

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

This project demonstrates:

- Firmware-aware testing logic (grey-box + black-box strategies)
- Low-level simulation of NAND-like constraints
- Python automation and structured test reporting
- Readable, maintainable validation code with logging and summaries

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `unittest`
- `logging`
- Custom file-based simulation of NAND memory

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps

- Simulate ECC and retry logic
- Add power-failure recovery simulation
- Integrate with pytest for more powerful testing
- Implement real bad block table (BBT) simulation
- Add GUI or CLI to trigger specific test suites
